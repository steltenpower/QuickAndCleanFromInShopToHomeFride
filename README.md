# QuickAndCleanFromInShopToHomeFridge
As you don't want to touch every grocery item many times

Improve on this already rather brilliant [Bike-Portable Shopping Cart]{https://www.instructables.com/id/Bike-Portable-Shopping-Cart/)

Some directions for improvement:
- A little quicker to put it on and off the bike
- Be able to do that operation while sitting on the bike
- Maybe use bamboo instead of the PVC parts, or other environmental improvements
- Put teasing slogans on it and a good URL; e.g. "parking at the door, lifting no more", speedshopwheels.com
